Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

 Ans. High level programming language cause its syntax resembles english language. More readble to humans, less readable to computers.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans. It is dynamically typed as we don't have to declare the type of a variable or manage the memory while assigning a value to a variable in Python.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

ans. ML, Data Analytics, 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them? 
Sol. Variables are which stores the values. name="PythonGeeks" _no = 5

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python? By using input()
Ans. By using the input() function. 
For eg:- 
 String_name = input("what's ur name?"
 Print(String_name)
 
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function? The default value is String.
Ans. String is the deafult datatype.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans. Conversion from a one data type to another one.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
 Ans. 
 Yes, we can using the split() function. To make multiple inputs from the users.
 e.g:- a, b, c = map(int, input("Enter the Numbers : ").split())
    print("The Numbers are : ",end = " ")
    print(a, b, c)

 Q10. What are keywords?
 Ans. Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. 
 
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. 
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans. There are several ways to deliver the output of a program. In Python, we use the print () function to output data to the screen. 


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. Python Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables.
These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. The difference between // and / is that // performs floor division, and / performs floating point division.
Floating point division is regular division, and floor division truncates the resulting quotient.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.

iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

Ans. print(("iNeuron")*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans. num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("{0} is Odd".format(num))

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans. The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. 
While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false.
e.g:-
>>> a=50
>>> b=25
>>> a>40 and b>40
False
>>> a>100 and b<50
False
>>> a==0 and b==0
False
>>> a>0 and b>0
True

Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans.  A conditional statement in python, also called a condition constructs, is a statement that accommodates a condition inside itself. 
This condition is constructed using the bitwise, boolean, and comparison operators in Python.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. 
If all the conditions are False, the body of else is executed. Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans. 
age=int(input("enter your age,please!\n23"))
if(age >= 18):
    print("I can vote")
elif(age < 18):
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.

Ans. list1=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
even_sum=0
for num in list1:
    if(num%2==0):
        even_sum=even_sum+num
print(even_sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans. a=int(input("Enter first no.: \n"))
b=int(input("Enter second no.: \n"))
c=int(input("Enter third no.: \n"))
if(a>=b) and (a>=c):
    largest = a
elif(b>=a) and (b>=c):
    largest = b
elif(c>=a) and (c>=b):
    largest = c
print("the largest amongst them is : ",largest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five

If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
result=[]
for num in numbers:
    if(num%5==0):
        if(num>150):
            result.append(num)
            continue
        elif(num>500):
            result.append(num)
            break
    print(result)  
Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans. We can use the single or double quotes to declare strings in python. 
Python does not have a character dtype, a character is simply a string with a length.

Sol. There are if-else, for, while, nested loops,

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
Sol. For loop: When we need to iterate over a sequence where we know the no of iterations before time but While Loop is morely used when we don't know the no of iteration before time.


Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
Sol. Continue statement will skip the result of that particular iteration(for or while) and will move forward to the next iteration.


Q72. What is the use of break statement?
Sol. Break statement will end the iterations and will come out of the loop.


Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
Sol. If a user dosen't know what to write int the code, they will simply write pass statement where empty code is not allowed which will pass the particular function, class or a statement.


Q74. What is the use of range() function?
Sol. Range function is used to sequence numbers by using start, stop and step parameters. range(start, stop) where stop parameter will be exclusive.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
Sol. my_dict ={'Age':'23','Name':'Farheen','Dept':'Data Engg','Salary':'Rs 30000'}
for k,v in my_dict.items():
    print(k,'-->',v)
